                <p> What did you today? I took a walk on the beach. Does that tell you    anything? One hundred different people might stare at the same sunset on the same beach on the same day and have one hundred different experiences. One man feels frustrated  because his phone is dead because he's a huge idiot who came home drunk and didn't plug it in so now he can’t post a photo of the sunset onto Instagram so his ex-girlfriend can't see it to know that he's having a truly fantastic time in Cabo, unfazed, strolling along the beach, admiring sunsets, not
          thinking about her at all.</p>
                 <p> One woman feels greatful that she arrived at the beach just as the sky bled red, whorls of violet whirling over the horizon, the light lingering for a moment, and then gone. Ten fooprints behind her, a younger woman thinks about the brief she has to file this weekend, waiting for her client to call her back any second, not noticing the sunset at all. </p>
                 <p> As dusk falls, one man stares at the sea, wishing he was a hard, empty, shell scraping along the ocean floor, thinking how freeing it would be to walk into the ocean with all his clothes on, letting the waves tumble over him until he sinks to
          the bottom like a heavy stone.</p>

            <div id="textwrapper">       
        <p>Our thoughts determine our moods, our days, our existence. The scientifically proven placebo and <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-is-the-nocebo-effect-5451823/">nocebo</a> effects show how positive and negative thoughts influence
          our responses to medical treatments. Negative thoughts can cause us feel physical pain. When we say statements like “I’m just in a bad mood today” or “he’s just pissing me off,” we reveal how we think of our moods as random, out of our control, or automatic. We conflate our
          moods with our thoughts, which do occur in a constant stream without our volition. Neuroscientists estimate that the average person has an average of 2,000-3000 thoughts an hour. If your thoughts are mostly negative, then it only follows your mood will
          be negative as well.
        </p>
        <p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a branch of therapy that characterizes mood disorders as simply the persistence of the same negative mood, composed of the same pattern of negative thoughts. CBT suggests that by becoming aware of our thoughts,
          we can disrupt the thought pattern, disrupt the mood, thereby disrupting the mood disorder.
          <p>
            <p> I was surprised to learn that those who suffer from the same mood disorders have very similar thought patterns. Depression is the persistence of thoughts of worthlessness, helplessness, pessimism, and exhaustion. “I can’t do anything right”
              “I’m unloveable” “There’s no point in even trying.” “I’ll never be happy.” Anger or Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is characterized by thoughts of self-righteousness, perfectionism, and control. “I don’t deserve to be treated this
              way” “this isn’t fair” “I should have done better.” Anxiety is characterized by thoughts that center around fear, doubt, and panic. “I’m going to fail,” “I’m having a heart attack,” “Everyone is going to see that photo and think I’m stupid and trying too hard.”
            </p>
         
       <p> While CBT sounds suspiciously simple in theory, in practice, it can feel nearly impossible to detangle and intercept the thoughts that determine your moods, especially while you’re in the throes of a particular disruptive mood. I recently challenged my own thought
              assumptions that I was not a "technical person," by completing a front-end-web development course. For my course final project, I wanted to design a website that incorporated some of the exercises designed to treat mood disorders. Even if
              you don’t suffer from a mood disorder, but just an occasional bad mood, you’re likely to still benefit from the exercises. While it’s optimal to complete the exercises while you’re experiencing the mood, you can still benefit from completing
              the exercise afterwards.</p>
            <p> Just like everything in life, the exercises will only work if you are committed to them and want to change your mood. Life isn’t just about “happiness” and if you want to revel in your occasional sulky or irritable mood, feel
              no shame, enjoy it, and continue. But if you are desperate to escape the prison of your mind, and find yourself in search for tools to change our mood and cultivate greater awareness of your own psyche, then this site is for you.</p>
            <div id="more">
             <p> If it takes as much energy to have negative thoughts as it does to have positive thoughts, why do negative thoughts persist? One potential explanation is that the mind has a tendency to form thought patterns, which can then hard to break.
              Another explanation is that the more we have the same similar negative thoughts,the more we start to believe these thoughts as "true" rather than just thoughts.</p>
 <p> Much like a self-fulfilling prophecy, our thoughts affect our physiological responses and our habits, thereby perpetuating the dominant thought pattern. For example, in the ultimate catch-22, individuals who suffer from depression also experience
              physical symptoms like exhaustion and aches and pains, which makes them even less likely to do activities like exercise, meeting with friends, and trying new hobbies, which could help them out of their depression. Rather, they isolate themselves
              further, staying home, ruminating in depressive thoughts, furthering their depression. Individuals who experience anxiety may feel a racing heart, shortness of breath, or dizziness, which may further their belief that they are having a heart
             
              attack or need to go to a hospital, furthering their anxious thoughts, furthering their symptoms.</p>
        <p>   Research shows that those who suffer from mood disorders have physiological changes in their brain. Those who suffer from depression show shrinkage in areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus, as well as have a decreased function of neurotransmitters.
              Those who suffer from intermittent explosive disorder (IED) have significantly lower volume of brain gray matter. We can take these physiological changes as evidence that negative thoughts and negative moods are an effect of a physiological
              change in the brain rather than the cause. We then look for treatments that can treat our physiological disturbance, such as antidepressents, rather than our thought patterns, such as CBT. Most research shows that CBT methods are as effective
              as antidepressants and more enduring. Most patients who take antidepressants without CBT are more likely to relapse. Obviously, a certain group of people who suffer from mood and psychiatric disorders do need and can benefit from medications,
              but personally, I believed that they are over-prescribed and should be prescribed in conjunction with therapy.</p>

I was at home, alone, lying on my bed, propped on my elbows, scrolling through Facebook. My limbs were stones. The algorithm showed me a photo of me from college with Jessica, our arms wrapped around each other like twins in the womb.

I was alone at Brewster, sitting at the last table in the back. Ariana Grande was blasting on the speakers. Her voice sounded like a siren. The heat was too high. The cafe was dimly lit with no natural light. The coffee tasted like tar. My heart was beating. Two girls at the next table were debating whether  there was an evolutionary basis for non-monogamy. She wanted to fuck the barista. She wanted another latte. She wanted hair like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. There was no air in the room."></textarea>

Often I don't even think of Jessica and didn't even think of her until I went on Facebook. Everyone makes it look like they're doing cool shit, but they are probably not in reality. I don't have many friends because I haven't really let anyone in. I do connect with people easily when I actually try. I haven't met anyone who I liked since Tommy, but I also don't ever go on dates or leave my house. When I do, guys tend to hit on me.

I haven't had an asthma attack since I was a kid. I left the cafe and went out for some fresh air. I took a few deep breaths. I realized I could breath fine. I called Lucy to talk about the biology test and realized I could also talk fine. She said that she was nervous too but reminded me that I always thought I would fail and then always did well. She made me realize I knew the material better than I thought I did. I realized that even if I failed this one test, I did well on the other ones, and it wouldn't be that big of a deal. I realized that I just couldn't focus in the cafe, and needed to go to the library instead.
