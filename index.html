  <div class="introtext">
    <p> Our thoughts determine our reality. One hundred different people might stare at the same sunset on the same beach on the same day and have one hundred different experiences. One man feels angry because his phone is dead because he's a huge idiot who came home drunk and didn't plug it in so now he can’t post a photo of the sunset onto Instagram so his ex-girlfriend can't see it to know that he's having a wonderful time in Cabo, unfazed, strolling along the beach, admiring sunsets, not thinking about her at all.</p>
    <p> One woman feels greatful that she arrived at the beach just as the sky bled red, whorls of violet whirling over the horizon, the light lingering for a moment, and then gone. While the woman ten footprints behind her thinks about all the remote work she has to do this weekend, waiting for her manager to email her any second, not noticing the sunset at all. </p>
    <p> As dusk falls, one man stares at the sea, wishing he was a hard, empty, shell scraping along the ocean floor, thinking how freeing it would be to walk into the ocean with all his clothes on, letting the waves tumble over him until he sinks to the bottom like a heavy stone. You get the idea.</p>
    <p>Our thoughts determine our moods which determines our days which determines our years which determine our lives. Our thoughts are powerful. The scientifically proven placebo and nocebo effects show how positive and negative thoughts influence our physiological responses to medical treatments. When we say statements like “I’m just in a bad mood today” or “he’s just pissing me off,” we reveal how we often think of our moods as random, out of our control, or automatic. We conflate our moods with our thoughts, which do often occur in a constant stream without our volition. Neuroscientists estimate that the average person has an average of 2,000-3000 thoughts an hour. If your thoughts are mostly negative, then your mood will be negative as well.
</p>
    <p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a branch of therapy that characterizes mood disorders as simply the persistence of the same negative mood, composed of the same persistent negative thoughts. CBT suggests that by becoming aware of our thoughts, we can disrupt the thought pattern, thereby disrupting the mood, thereby disrupting the mood disorder.<p> 
<p> I was surprised to learn that those who suffer from the same mood disorders have very similar thought patterns. Depression is the persistence of thoughts of worthlessness, helplessness, pessimism, and exhaustion. “I can’t do anything right” “I’m unloveable” “There’s no point in even trying.” “I’ll never be happy.” Anger or Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is characterized by thoughts of self-righteousness, perfectionism, and control. “I don’t deserve to be treated this way” “this isn’t fair” “I should have done better.” Anxiety is characterized by thoughts that center around fear, doubt, and panic. “I’m going to fail,” “I’m having a heart attack,” “Everyone is going to see that photo and think I’m trying too hard.” 
</p>
    <p>If it takes as much energy to have negative thoughts as it does to have positive thoughts, why do negative thoughts persist? One potential explanation is that the mind has a tendency to form thought patterns, which can then hard to break. Another explanation is that the more we have the same similar negative thoughts,the more we start to believe these thoughts as "true" rather than just thoughts.</p> 
    <p> Much like a self-fulfilling prophecy, our thoughts affect our physiological responses and our habits, thereby perpetuating the dominant thought pattern. For example, in the ultimate catch-22, individuals who suffer from depression also experience physical symptoms like exhaustion and aches and pains, which makes them even less likely to do activities like exercise, meeting with friends, and trying new hobbies, which could help them out of their depression. Rather, they isolate themselves further, staying home, ruminating in depressive thoughts, furthering their depression. Individuals who experience anxiety may feel a racing heart, shortness of breath, or dizziness, which may further their belief that they are having a heart attack or need to go to a hospital, furthering their anxious thoughts, furthering their symptoms.</p>
    <p> Research shows that those who suffer from mood disorders have physiological changes in their brain. Those who suffer from depression show shrinkage in areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus, as well as have a decreased function of neurotransmitters. Those who suffer from intermittent explosive disorder (IED) have significantly lower volume of brain gray matter. We can take these physiological changes as evidence that negative thoughts and negative moods are an effect of a physiological change in the brain rather than the cause. We then look for treatments that can treat our physiological disturbance, such as antidepressents, rather than our thought patterns, such as CBT. Most research shows that CBT methods are as effective as antidepressants and more enduring. Most patients who take antidepressants without CBT are more likely to relapse. Obviously, a certain group of people who suffer from mood and psychiatric disorders do need and can benefit from medications, but personally, I believed that they are over-prescribed and should be prescribed in conjunction with therapy.   
    </p>
    <p> While CBT sounds so simple in theory, in practice, it can be extremely difficult to detangle the thoughts that determine your moods, especially while you’re in the throes of a particular disruptive mood. I recently challenged my own thought assumptions that I was not a "technical person," by completing a front-end-web development course. For my course final project, I wanted to design a website that incorporated some of the exercises designed to treat mood disorders. Even if you don’t suffer from a mood disorder, but just an occasional bad mood, you’re likely to still benefit from the exercises. While it’s optimal to complete the exercises while you’re experiencing the mood, you can still benefit from completing the exercise afterwards.</p>
    <p> Just like almost everything in this world, the exercises will only work if you are committed to them and want to change your mood. Life isn’t just about “happiness” and if you want to revel in your occasional sulky or irritable mood, feel no shame, enjoy it, and continue. But if you are desperate to escape the prison of your mind, and find yourself in search for tools to change our mood and cultivate greater awareness of your own psyche, then this site is for you.
